# OCR_Compiler
__OCR_Compiler__ is a web application designed to streamline the process of working with
handwritten code. Leveraging the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, 
this project aims to bridge the gap between analog and digital programming by
enabling users to scan handwritten code, convert it to editable text, prettify the code, and
ultimately compile it.

# Installation
<sub><sup>__Note__: This project uses the Flask framework written in Python. So you need a python interpreter on your system.</sup></sub>
### For Linux/MacOS/Windows:
+ Clone the repo:
    ` git clone https://github.com/DhirazX/OCRcompiler.git`
+ Make a virtual environment inside server dir. Eg:
    `python -m venv venv`
+ Activate the virtual environment. Eg:
    `source ./venv/bin/activate`
+ Install the dependencies from the repo's requirements.txt file.
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
+ Run the following code:
    `npm start`  `node compiler` 
+ Run the server.
    `python server.py`
+ Go to the url `localhost:3000` on your browser.

# Objectives
+ The current objective of the project is:
    - Accurate code recognition from printed or handwritten sources.
    - Support for different writing styles.
    - High accuracy and reliability in code recognition to minimize errors.
